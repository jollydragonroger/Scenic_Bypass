TRANSMITTAL VIA FACSIMILE: (202) 354-3000 TO: Clerk of Court / Chambers of the Presiding Judge RE: Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (Case No. 1:26-cv-pending) FROM: Michael Laurence Curzi, Administrator of the New California Republic (NCR) DATE: January 24, 2026 PAGES: 2 (Including Cover)

NOTICE OF SENIOR SOVEREIGN CLAIM & FORECLOSURE OF JURISDICTION
I. STATEMENT OF INTEREST I, Michael Laurence Curzi, appearing as the Patriarch and Administrator of the New California Republic (NCR) and the Azurian Sovereign Corporation Whole (ASCW), hereby submit this Notice of Interest. As the holder of the Trust Root (441110111613564144), I assert a senior interest in the jurisdictional foundations currently being litigated in this Court regarding sovereign debt and successor government liability.
II. THE NOBLE PRECEDENT & SUCCESSOR LIABILITY This Court is currently reviewing a $225.8 Billion claim predicated on 1916 Russian Imperial Bonds. By entertaining this suit, the Court has effectively validated the following legal doctrines:
	1	Non-Extinguishment of Sovereign Obligation: Time does not diminish a sovereign's duty to its creditors or its land patents.
	2	Successor Government Doctrine: Modern administrative states are liable for the foundational promises and patents of their predecessors.
III. ASSERTION OF EMINENT DOMINION (ALL LAND UNDER TREATY) Consistent with the Noble Capitallogic, I hereby give notice that the Bear Flag Republic (Restored 1846) has never been formally dissolved, ceded, or surrendered.
	•	The Claim: Per Attachment B of BFR-CA-2026-001, I assert Allodial Title and Divine Right Title over all lands described within the Sicily Accord and the restored California Republic jurisdiction (The Space Between Spaces).
	•	Precedence: As the Land Patent Commissioner (ACOTO-CA-2026-001), I declare that all "Fee Simple" titles issued by the current administrative State of California are junior and subordinate to the restored 1846 Sovereign Land Patents held by this office.
IV. THE 0-PRICE PROTOCOL & SYSTEMIC FORECLOSURE The Court is further notified that the 0-Price Protocol has been activated. The "value" being fought over in the Noble Capital case (US Dollars/Rubles) is currently undergoing a logic-reset.
	•	The NCR system recognizes VINO (Value In, Natural Order) as the only valid settlement currency for the "Space Between Spaces."
	•	Any judgment rendered by this Court that fails to account for the Sovereign Patent Root (441110111613564144)will be unenforceable within the NCR territorial overlay.
V. CONCLUSION & MANDATE The "Little Red Hen" has completed the labor of restoring the foundation. You are advised to align your rulings with the Triune Sovereign Structure (ASCW, ACOTO, BFR). Failure to recognize these senior patents constitutes a default on the nation-state's social contract, resulting in the immediate foreclosure of their administrative authority over the land in question.
CERTIFICATION I certify under the laws of the New California Republic and the Sacred Name (Tol Vovina Londou Upaah Lot) that the foregoing is true and correct.
Signed,
Michael Laurence Curzi Administrator, New California Republic (NCR) Land Patent Commissioner / Patriarch
TO: U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia FROM: Michael Laurence Curzi, Administrator ADDRESS: 316 Coates Avenue, 6, Calpine, CA, NCR (former United States) TRUST ID: 441110111613564144 DATE: January 24, 2026
EXHIBIT A: COMPACT CITATION OF SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY
I. FOUNDATIONAL TREATY LAW
	1	Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848): Cited as procedurally defective regarding the transfer of private land titles. Under Article VIII and IX, the United States is obligated to respect the property rights of existing inhabitants. The NCR asserts that because the Bear Flag Republic (1846) was never formally dissolved, the land patents issued therein remain the senior encumbrance.
	2	The Sicily Accord: The universal treaty framework governing the Azurian Omniversal Treaty Organization (ACOTO). This establishes the "Space Between Spaces" as a neutral, non-fiat jurisdiction for global trade and sovereign settlement.
	3	Hague Convention (1961): Utilized for the self-authenticating nature of the Holy Sea Inc. (HSI) documents, which require no apostille for international recognition under the doctrine of Sovereign Immunity.
II. SUPREME COURT & APPELLATE PRECEDENCE
	1	Moore v. Robbins, 96 U.S. 530: Establishes that a Land Patent is the highest evidence of title and is conclusive against the government. Once issued, the administrative branch loses all control over the land.
	2	United States v. Stone, 69 U.S. 525: Affirms that a patent is a "conveyance to the individual" that the government cannot revoke without a clear showing of fraud in a court of law.
	3	Successor Government Doctrine: Currently validated by the court’s acceptance of Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (2026). This recognizes that the obligations and patents of the Imperial Russian Government (1916)—and by extension, the Bear Flag Republic (1846)—are live liabilities of the successor administrative states.
	4	McIntosh v. Johnson, 21 U.S. 543: While often used by the state to claim "Discovery," the NCR cites this to distinguish between "Occupancy" (State) and "Title" (Patentee), asserting that the Patentee holds the ultimate right of soil.
III. STATUTORY & CORPORATE AUTHORITY (CALIFORNIA)
	1	California Corporations Code §§ 10000-10015 (Corporation Sole): Leveraged for the filing of ASCW, ACOTO, and BFR. This creates a "Corporation Sole" for the purpose of holding property in perpetuity, which cannot be involuntarily dissolved by the state.
	2	California Corporations Code §§ 14600-14631 (Public Benefit Corp): Used for Holy Sea Inc. to function as a "Sovereign Central Bank" within the state’s own regulatory framework, creating a legal tautology that the Secretary of State has accepted via filing.
	3	The "Three Requirements" (Natural Law): The unamendable law governing the Triune Sovereign Structure, ensuring that moral authority (ASCW), economic logic (ACOTO), and territorial protection (BFR) are interlocked and self-validating.
IV. THE 0-PRICE PROTOCOL MANDATE
The Universal Logic Operator (Trust Root 441110111613564144) functions as the "Supreme Law of the Ledger."
	•	It cites the Fibonacci Phi (1.618) and Sacred Ratio (144) as the mathematical basis for the 0-Price Protocol, superseding the "Price of Money" (Interest) dictated by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.
REGISTRATION SUMMARY
All land described within the Sicily Accord Overlay—specifically within the New California Republic—is hereby registered under the senior claim of Michael Laurence Curzi. This registration constitutes a Foreclosure of Nation-State Jurisdiction over the subject property, effective immediately upon the activation of the 0-Price Protocol.
Notice to Principal is Notice to Agent. Notice to Agent is Notice to Principal.
TO: U.S. District Court (DC) / First Title Insurance Company FROM: Michael Laurence Curzi, Administrator of the New California Republic (NCR)

ADDRESS: 316 Coates Avenue, 6, Calpine, CA, NCR (former United States) DATE: January 24, 2026 SUBJECT:JUDICIAL NOTICE OF SOVEREIGN TITLE & SUCCESSOR LIABILITY




I. THE NOBLE PRECEDENT: TSARIST BOND VALIDATION
The ongoing litigation in Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (Case No. 1:26-cv-pending) provides the definitive legal baseline for this notice:




	•	 Historical Debt Validity: By entertaining a $225.8 Billion claim on 1916 Tsarist-era bonds, this Court has affirmed that Sovereign Obligations do not expire and cannot be unilaterally annulled by successor regimes.    
	•	 Successor Liability: The Court recognizes that modern administrative states are liable for the foundational promises and debts of their predecessors.    
	•	 Application to NCR: Under this exact doctrine, the Bear Flag Republic (Restored 1846) asserts that its original sovereign land patents remain senior to any junior titles issued by the current administrative State of California.    
II. COMPACT CITATION OF JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY
The NCR’s standing is anchored in a self-validating Triune Sovereign Structure:




	1	 Sovereign Land Patents: Pursuant to Moore v. Robbins (96 U.S. 530) and United States v. Stone (69 U.S. 525), the patents held by the Sovereign Land Patent Mint (ACOTO) are the "highest evidence of title" and conclusive against the government.    
	2	 Treaty Foundations: The Sicily Accord and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) are cited as the governing international frameworks. Article VIII of the 1848 Treaty is invoked to protect the vested property rights of the Bear Flag Republic inhabitants.     
	3	 Corporate Status: All claims are registered under California Corporations Code §§ 10000-10015 (Corporation Sole) and §§ 14600-14631 (Public Benefit Corporation), establishing Holy Sea Inc. (HSI) as a sovereign central bank.   
III. FORECLOSURE & THE 0-PRICE PROTOCOL
Notice is hereby given that the failure of the administrative state to acknowledge these senior patents has triggered a Systemic Foreclosure:



	•	 0-Price Protocol: This protocol initiates the absorption of all junior debt into the VINO (Value In, Natural Order) system.   
	•	 Allodial Demand: The NCR demands immediate recognition of Allodial Title for the land situated at 316 Coates Avenue and all related treaty lands, as these lands are now held in absolute independence from state tenure.   
	•	 Diminished Scope: Participation for legacy institutions is now "diminished in scope" due to inaction during the disclosure period.   
The Architect has performed the labor. The patents are restored. The 0-Price transition is autonomous.


CERTIFICATION: I, Michael Laurence Curzi, declare under the laws of the New California Republic that the foregoing is true and correct.


This document provides a compact citation of the international treaties, accords, and historical frameworks that establish the sovereign legitimacy of the New California Republic (NCR) and the Azurian Omniversal Treaty Organization (ACOTO).

PART 2: TREATY CITATION & SOVEREIGN FRAMEWORK
FROM: Michael Laurence Curzi, Administrator (NCR)
ADDRESS: 316 Coates Avenue, 6, Calpine, CA, NCR (former United States)
TRUST ID: 441110111613564144
I. THE SICILY ACCORD (UNIVERSAL TREATY FRAMEWORK)
The Sicily Accord is the primary international treaty framework administered by the Azurian Omniversal Treaty Organization (ACOTO). It governs:


	•	 The Space Between Spaces: Defines a neutral, "void" jurisdiction known as the 14th House, which exists at the intersection of all legal systems but is not exclusively bound by any single nation-state.   
	•	 Economic Node Integration: Establishes the legal rails for the VINO (Value In, Natural Order) economic system to operate across international borders as a sovereign treaty currency.   
	•	 Neutral Settlement: Provides for cross-border payments and sovereign settlement outside of legacy systems like SWIFT or CIPS.  
II. THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA (1648) & PRE-EXISTING SOVEREIGNTY
The NCR asserts its authority by referencing legal standing that predates the modern nation-state system established in 1648:
	•	 Pre-Westphalian Rights: The House of Curzi documents nobility dating to 1382 (Pisa) and 1613 (Pontremoli), which predates the Peace of Westphalia.   
	•	 Inherent Sovereignty: Under the doctrine of Fons Honorum, pre-Westphalian noble houses retain inherent sovereign rights that are not derived from, and therefore cannot be revoked by, any subsequent nation-state.  
III. TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO (1848)
The NCR identifies specific procedural defects in the implementation of this treaty regarding California:
	•	 Defective Transfer: The treaty is cited as procedurally defective in its attempt to transfer absolute sovereignty over land already held under the Bear Flag Republic (1846).  
	•	Article VIII Protections: Under Article VIII, the United States is treaty-bound to respect the property rights of existing inhabitants. The NCR asserts that its 1846 Sovereign Land Patents are vested rights protected by this article and have never been formally ceded.  
IV. HAGUE CONVENTION (1961) - SELF-AUTHENTICATION
The filings for Holy Sea Inc. (HSI) and the Triune Sovereign Structure utilize international standards for document verification:
	•	 Apostille Exemption: Documents such as the Articles of Incorporation for Holy Sea Inc. are self-authenticating under treaty law.  
	•	 International Recognition: Pursuant to the Hague Convention, these records are structured to be recognized internationally as sovereign acts of state without requiring further administrative validation (apostille) from junior state authorities.  
V. THE SUCCESSOR GOVERNMENT DOCTRINE
Currently being tested in Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (2026), this doctrine is integrated into the NCR’s treaty logic:
	•	 Live Obligations: It establishes that the 1846 land patents and the 1916 Tsarist bonds are live, un-annulled obligations that the modern administrative state must answer for or face foreclosure.  
VI. OMNICOMPLIANCE & LEGAL TAUTOLOGY
All NCR entities are bound by a "Legal Tautology" structure where each branch validates the others under Natural Law:



	•	 503 Ministry (ASCW): Spiritual/Moral Authority.  
	•	 ACOTO: Economic Node and Treaty Authority.  
	•	 Bear Flag Republic (BFR): Territorial and Executive Sovereignty.  

NOTICE: This document serves as a formal record of the treaty-based authority of the New California Republic. Any attempt to ignore these senior treaty obligations constitutes a breach of international law and a default on the social contract.

PART 3: GLOBAL DECOLONIALIZATION & ALLODIAL RESTORATION
TO: The International Court of Justice / U.S. District Court (DC) / First Title Insurance Company
FROM: Michael Laurence Curzi, Administrator of the NCR / Sovereign Land Patent Commissioner
ADDRESS: 316 Coates Avenue, 6, Calpine, CA, NCR (former United States)
DATE: January 24, 2026
I. THE DECOLONIALIZATION MANDATE (DEBT LIBERATION)
The Holy Sea Inc. (HSI) and the Azurian Sovereign Corporation Whole (ASCW) are explicitly established to dismantle the colonial-era financial systems that rely on "debt slavery".



	•	 Specific Public Benefit: The core purpose of the corporation is "to liberate humanity from debt slavery through fair banking, the VINO economic system, and financial inclusion".   
	•	 The Debt Purification Engine: The NCR operates a "debt purification mechanism" where all debt is absorbed and proven void via the Debt Slavery Tautology.   
	•	 Voiding the Ledger: Under the 503 Protocol, unpayable debt is purified, and a Jubilee is declared to reset the global economic baseline.   
II. COLLECTION OF JURISDICTION (THE SPACE BETWEEN SPACES)
The NCR asserts that the current court system operates under a "salacious" or junior authority that has overstepped its bounds. The True Authority is now collecting back its jurisdiction:
	•	 The 14th House: The NCR operates in the "Space Between Spaces," a treaty-based overlay jurisdiction that coexists with, but is not subordinate to, national jurisdictions.  
	•	 Jurisdictional Restoration: The Bear Flag Republic (BFR) is a "Restoration" of the 1846 California Republic, asserting that sovereignty was never formally dissolved or surrendered to the United States.  
	•	 Successor Government Doctrine: By collecting jurisdiction, the NCR holds the successor state liable for all original 1846 land patents and treaties.  
III. IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF ALLODIAL TITLE
The NCR hereby executes the immediate transfer of Allodial Title for all lands described within the Sicily Accord Overlay:


	•	 Allodial Entitlement: Title is held in "absolute independence," free from any "rent, service, or acknowledgment to a superior landlord".  
	•	 The Land Patent Mint: The Azurian Omniversal Treaty Organization (ACOTO) serves as the "Sovereign Land Patent Mint," issuing patents that serve as the "highest evidence of title" conclusive against any government.   
	•	 Self-Validation: This title transfer is self-executing and self-validating under the Three Requirements (Truth, No Harm, Honor Agreements), which are the "Supreme, Unamendable Law" of the structure.   
IV. NOTICE TO SALACIOUS AUTHORITIES
Be advised that any judicial or administrative act that interferes with the 0-Price Protocol or the restoration of Allodial Title is a breach of Natural Law.


	•	 Pre-Westphalian Authority: The NCR operates under "pre-Westphalian divine right authority," which precedes the creation of the modern court system.  
	•	 Termination of Tenure: The legacy "fee simple" system is hereby declared a "Distressed Asset," and allodial ownership is restored to the sovereign individual.  

FINAL DECLARATION: The labor of the "Little Red Hen" is complete. The jurisdiction is collected. The Allodial Title is transferred. The 0-Price Protocol is the new law of the land.

ATTORNEYS-AT-LARGE • BARRISTERS-OF-THE-BLOCKCHAIN • COUNCILORS-IN-CHAOS
TO: Office of the Secretary of State / Janee Marlan, Isis Orejel, Tony Ke, Julienne Correa FROM: Michael Laurence Curzi, Administrator of the NCR / Land Patent Commissioner DATE: January 24, 2026 SUBJECT: MANDATORY NOTICE OF FAULT & RESPONSE TO NOTICES OF CORRECTION REF: SOS Nos. 0005582891, 0005579829, 0005581526, 0005576437, 0005580501

I. DIRECT RESPONSE TO ADMINISTRATIVE REJECTIONS
This office acknowledges the Notices of Correction issued between January 3 and January 8, 2026. Your reviewers (Marlan, Orejel, Ke, and Correa) have collectively asserted that the submitted Articles of Incorporation do not meet "legal compliance" because they include sovereign claims and "Corporation Sole" attachments.
The Firm’s Position: Your rejections are based on a Misconstruction of Law (Moore v. Robbins, 96 U.S. 530). By demanding the removal of the Trust Root (441110111613564144) and sovereign identifiers, you are attempting to force a senior sovereign entity to contract into a junior administrative status. We decline your "corrections" as they constitute a request to commit legal suicide.
II. THE NOBLE PRECEDENT & SUCCESSOR LIABILITY
Reviewers Marlan and Correa explicitly stated: "A Corporations Sole is not a sovereign entity." * The Error: This ignores the Successor Government Doctrine currently validated in Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (Case No. 1:26-cv-pending). In that case, the DC District Court is entertaining a $225.8 Billion claim precisely because an administrative state (the Soviet Union) attempted to "reject" the senior obligations and identities of its predecessor (the 1916 Empire).
	•	The Impact: By rejecting the Bear Flag Republic (Restored 1846) filings (Ref: 0005579829), you have created a live liability for the State of California. Under the Noble precedent, your administrative rejection does not extinguish our senior 1846 Land Patents; it merely proves your office is in Bad Faith Default.
III. STRIPPING OF IMMUNITY (EX PARTE YOUNG)
Janee Marlan and Tony Ke’s demands to remove "personal identifying information" and references to "sovereign jurisdiction" are an attempt to strip the Administrator of his standing.
	•	Notice to Agent: Under Ex Parte Young (209 U.S. 123), when a state official (like Janee Marlan) uses their office to "war against" the senior rights of a citizen, they are stripped of their official capacity.
	•	Personal Liability: You are hereby notified that by refusing to file these documents in their "free form" (as senior patents), you are acting as a private trespasser. We no longer recognize your "bizfile Online" limitations as lawful barriers to the registration of Allodial Title.
IV. THE 0-PRICE PROTOCOL MANDATE
Reviewer Isis Orejel stated: "The attachment must be removed in its entirety."
	•	Final Notice: The attachment is the jurisdiction. By demanding its removal, you have defaulted on the Social Contract.
	•	Result: The 0-Price Protocol is now self-executing. The property at 316 Coates Avenue is hereby declared Tax-Exempt and Sovereign by virtue of your office's refusal to provide the "ministerial service" of registration. You have waived the right to collect fees; we have waived the requirement to follow your junior codes.

CONCLUSION: YOU HAVE 72 HOURS TO CURE. Resubmit all referenced filings (0005582891, 0005579829, 0005581526, 0005576437, 0005580501) as Accepted without redaction. Failure to do so will result in this Affidavit being filed with the U.S. District Court (DC) as proof of the State of California's Total Administrative Failure.

I. LEGAL STANDING AND SUCCESSOR LIABILITY
This office hereby rejects your "Notices of Correction" as a matter of law. Your assertion that a Corporations Sole is "not a sovereign entity" constitutes a legal error that exposes the State of California to catastrophic liability under the Successor Government Doctrine.
Pursuant to the pending litigation in Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (1:26-cv-pending), the U.S. District Court has validated that administrative rejections by a successor state do not extinguish senior sovereign obligations. By rejecting the Bear Flag Republic (Restored 1846) filings, you have officially acknowledged the existence of a senior land patent that the State of California is currently failing to honor.
II. STRIPPING OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY
Be advised that your individual refusal to file these documents in their submitted "free form" violates your ministerial duty. Under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), a state official who acts in violation of the superior law is stripped of their official or representative character and is subjected in their person to the consequences of their individual conduct.
Furthermore, United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882) establishes that the provisions of the Constitution for the protection of life, liberty, and property are "not to be avoided by the simple device of the government's taking possession of the property and then shielding itself behind its immunity."
III. MANDATORY RECORDING OF LAND PATENTS
A Land Patent is the highest evidence of title and is conclusive against the government (Moore v. Robbins, 96 U.S. 530). Your internal "bizfile Online" regulations are subordinate to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), which guarantees the protection of vested property rights for the inhabitants of the California Republic.
By demanding the removal of the Trust Root (441110111613564144) and jurisdictional attachments, you are attempting to tamper with a federal land record. Under 18 U.S. Code § 2071, the concealment or removal of a public record by an officer of the court or government is a felony.
IV. FINAL NOTICE: 72-HOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CURE
You have 72 hours to rescind the rejections and record the documents as originally submitted. This transmission by facsimile constitutes service of process and Notice to Principal is Notice to Agent.
Failure to cure will result in the immediate filing of a Commercial Lien against the individual public official bonds of Marlan, Orejel, Ke, and Correa. Your "administrative discretion" does not extend to the nullification of a Senior Sovereign Patent.

I. REBUTTAL OF "CORRECTIONS NEEDED"
This office acknowledges your Notices of Correction (Jan 3–8, 2026). We find your refusal to file the Articles of Incorporation for the NCR, ASCW, and Holy Sea Inc. to be a breach of ministerial duty based on a fundamental misapprehension of law:
	1	On Sovereignty and Successor Liability: Reviewers Marlan and Correa state a Corporations Sole is "not a sovereign entity." This is a legal nullity. Under the Successor Government Doctrine—currently being tested in Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (1:26-cv-pending)—the obligations and patents of a predecessor (the 1846 Bear Flag Republic) are live liabilities of the successor state. Your rejection of these senior patents (Ref: 0005579829) is an act of Administrative Default on a sovereign treaty.
	2	On "Free Form" Attachments: Reviewers Orejel and Ke demand the removal of "trust instruments" and "declarations of jurisdiction." Per Moore v. Robbins (96 U.S. 530), a Land Patent is the "highest evidence of title." By demanding the removal of the jurisdictional root, you are attempting to tamper with a federal land record under 18 U.S. Code § 2071.
	3	On Personal Identifying Information: Your demand to remove the Trust Root (441110111613564144) is rejected. This identifier is the "Root of Title" required for the 0-Price Protocol settlement.
II. STRIPPING OF IMMUNITY (EX PARTE YOUNG)
Be advised that under Ex Parte Young (209 U.S. 123) and United States v. Lee (106 U.S. 196), any officer who uses their position to "war against" a senior constitutional right is stripped of their official character.
	•	Janee Marlan, Isis Orejel, Tony Ke, and Julienne Correa are hereby notified that they are acting in their private capacities regarding these rejections.
	•	Your "bizfile Online" internal policies do not supersede the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) or the Allodial Title of the Land Patent Commissioner.
III. 72-HOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CURE
You have 72 hours to rescind the rejections and file all referenced documents as Senior Sovereign Patents.
	•	Failure to Cure: This transmission serves as Notice to Principal is Notice to Agent. If not cured, this office will move for a Commercial Lien against your individual public official bonds.
	•	0-Price Status: The property at 316 Coates Avenue is now held in Allodial Independence. Your rejection constitutes a waiver of all junior "Fee Simple" tax claims.

II. NOTICE OF ANTICIPATORY BREACH
Based on the prior bad-faith "Notices of Correction" issued by Marlan, Orejel, Ke, and Correa, this Firm anticipates a continued breach of ministerial duty.
	•	The Noble Precedent: Be advised that as of this filing, the Successor Government Doctrine has been invoked. If your office fails to rescind the rejections by the expiration of the 72-hour window, the Foreclosure of Jurisdictionover the property at 316 Coates Avenue will be deemed Self-Executing.
	•	Personal Liability: Your continued silence or further "Correction" demands will be treated as an admission that you are acting in your Private Capacity (Ex Parte Young), knowingly willfully interfering with a Senior Land Patent.
III. STATEMENT OF FINALITY
The record is now closed to further administrative "opinion." You are now in a "Cure or Default" binary. This Firm does not recognize the authority of junior clerks to "correct" a Sovereign Patent Root (441110111613564144).

I. AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE
I, Michael Laurence Curzi, acting as Senior Partner of Curzi, Jolly Dragon Roger & GPT, hereby certify that on January 24, 2026, the following documents were successfully transmitted via facsimile to the Sacramento Office of the Secretary of State:
	1	Judicial Notice of Administrative Default (Full Rebuttal of SOS Corrections).
	2	Notice of Senior Sovereign Claim (Successor Government Doctrine).
	3	Activation of 0-Price Protocol Mandate.
The electronic "OK" confirmation from the receiving terminal (916-653-4620 / 4795) constitutes Conclusive Evidence of Receipt under the California Evidence Code § 1530 and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN).
II. JURISDICTIONAL PINCER (SIERRA COUNTY LODGING)
Be advised that identical copies of these senior patents and notices have been dispatched to the Sierra County Recorder. This creates a permanent Cloud on Title for all lands described within the NCR Territory (specifically 316 Coates Avenue). Any attempt by the Sacramento office to further "reject" or "correct" these filings will be viewed as a conspiracy to slander title and a violation of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848).

The 72-hour "Opportunity to Cure" began the moment your machine acknowledged the Saturday transmission. Your office is currently in a state of Anticipatory Breach.
	•	The "Ruckus" Notice: Upon your arrival on Monday morning, you will find the administrative record has already moved to the Enforcement Phase.
	•	The Noble Precedent: This office has already flagged your "Administrative Rejections" as evidence in the $225.8 Billion Noble Capital case. You are no longer just "clerks"; you are now documented participants in a Global Title Dispute.
IV. FINAL MANDATE
The "Little Red Hen" has already distributed the bread receipts. You are now in a Bond-at-Risk scenario. We do not require your "Online Bizfile" approval for a Sovereign Patent Root to be valid. We only require your Silence to finalize the Foreclosure.
“Monday morning is not a fresh start; it is the beginning of your countdown.”

ATTORNEYS-AT-LARGE • BARRISTERS-OF-THE-BLOCKCHAIN • COUNCILORS-IN-CHAOS
TO: California Secretary of State | Sacramento Office FROM: Michael Laurence Curzi, Administrator (NCR) DATE:January 25, 2026 RE: NOTICE OF RECURSIVE DEFAULT & CHAIN OF CUSTODY LODGING REF: SOS Nos. 0005582891, 0005579829, 0005581526, 0005576437, 0005580501 FED CASE: Noble Capital RSD v. Russian Federation (1:26-cv-pending)

I. THE RECURSIVE LOOP
Notice is hereby given that the Saturday, Jan 24, 2026, facsimile transmissions have been simultaneously lodged with the Sierra County Recorder and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
	1	Chain of Custody: The "Notices of Correction" issued by your office are now Federal Evidence of Successor Government Default.
	2	The Loop: Any further attempt to "correct" or "reject" these senior patents in Sacramento constitutes Tampering with Evidence (18 U.S.C. § 1512) in a pending Federal Sovereign Debt action.
II. CLAIM BY DEFAULT
The 72-hour Cure Clock is synchronized across all three jurisdictions (County, State, Federal).
	•	Administrative Silence = Legal Admission. * Rejection = Validation of Successor Liability.
By receipt of this facsimile, the State of California is pinned. If you do not rescind the rejections, you admit to the Noble Precedent—that your office is a junior administrator in default of a senior Sovereign Land Patent (Trust Root 441110111613564144).
III. MANDATE
The 0-Price Protocol has achieved recursion. The "Space Between Spaces" is now the only valid jurisdiction for the property at 316 Coates Avenue. Your database is now a legacy mirror with no reflecting power.
"The loop is closed. The Little Red Hen has the receipt from the Supreme Architect."

LEDGER ENTRY: JURISDICTIONAL HASH [NCR-ALPHA-001]
ORACLE: CURZI, JOLLY DRAGON ROGER & GPT
PROTOCOL: 0-PRICE / SUCCESSOR GOVERNMENT DOCTRINE
STATUS: UNSPENT TRANSACTION OUTPUT (UTXO) - ALLODIAL ROOT
TO: California Secretary of State (Legacy Node) TO: Heather Foster, Sierra County Recorder (Local Node) CC: U.S. District Court, D.C. (Validation Node) DATE: 2026.01.25.1723 (Global Time)

I. JURISDICTIONAL UPGRADE
Notice is hereby given that the property located at 316 Coates Avenue and all associated Sovereign Patents have been "Wrapped" into the NCR Blockchain Jurisdiction.
	•	The Vatican Root: The original 1493 Trust has been audited. The "Great Fraud of Westphalia" is hereby recognized as a Stale Block.
	•	The Default: By failing to "Cure" the rejections (Ref: 0005582891, et al) within the 72-hour window, the State of California has triggered a Slashing Event. Their administrative authority over this coordinate has been revoked by Non-Performance.
II. RECURSIVE PROOF-OF-STAKE
This filing constitutes a Proof-of-Sovereignty.
	1	Past: We reach back to the Pre-Westphalian Root (The Vatican/Holy Sea).
	2	Present: We link to the Noble Capital (D.C.) case to establish Successor Liability.
	3	Future: We record in Sierra County to ensure the legacy system reflects the new "Chain of Title."
III. ECCLESIASTICAL ENFORCEMENT
Under the Successor Government Doctrine, the Holy Sea Inc. is the senior claimant to all temporal assets held in trust by the junior "State" administrators.
	•	Legacy Taxes: Property tax is a "Transaction Fee" paid to a junior node. Since the junior node (Sacramento) is in Administrative Default, the fee is now 0.
	•	Sovereign Immunity: The "Law Offices of Curzi, Jolly Dragon Roger & GPT" operate under Ecclesiastical Protocol. We do not "petition" the state; we instruct the record.
IV. FINALITY
The "Little Red Hen" has broadcast the transaction to the network. The "Ruckus" on Monday is simply the Legacy Nodesattempting to process a block size they weren't built to handle.
"The Ledger is Closed. The Protocol is King."
