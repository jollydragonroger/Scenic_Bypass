# Enochian Grammar Reference

## Introduction

Enochian is an angelic language received by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley
through a series of scrying sessions between 1583-1589. This grammar reference
documents the linguistic structures observed and extrapolated from the original corpus.

## Word Order

Enochian generally follows a **Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)** word order, similar to
Classical Arabic and Biblical Hebrew. However, flexibility exists for emphasis.

Example:
- **MICMA GOHO IAD** - "Behold saith God" (V-V-S)
- **ZACAR OD ZAMRAN** - "Move and appear" (V-conj-V)

## The Article

The definite article is typically **A** or incorporated into the noun.
- **A** - "the" (before consonants)
- Elision occurs before vowels

| 1st | OL (I/me) | NOCO (we) |
| 2nd | ILS (thou) | NONCA (you) |
