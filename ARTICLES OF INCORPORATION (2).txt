DYNASTIC AUTHORITY

HOUSE OF CURZI - COMPLETE LINEAGE DOCUMENTATION
Primary Source: Libro d'Oro della Nobilta Italiana
Extended Sources: Vatican Archives, Sicilian Royal Records,
Pisan Republic Registers
TRANSLATION OF PEDIGREE DOCUMENT:
CURZI
The family was inscribed in the Patriciate of Pisa by
decree of September 9, 1754, having been repeatedly
received for justice in the Order of S. Stefano, and having
enjoyed, from 1613, the first honor of the city of
Pontremoli, obtained the nobility of this city by decree of
November 29, 1782.
Francesco di Filippo Galletti, on the date of October 10,
1765, instituted a fideicommissum in favor of the male
descendants of his daughter Maddalena, married to Jacopo
C., fideicommissum accepted by Biagio di Jacopo in 1799 and
by Camillo di Jacopo in 1803, who added to their own the
cognomen of Galletti.
The Fam. Galletti had for ancestor Andreotto, Anziano of
the Republic of Pisa in 1382. Subsequently, towards the
beginning of the 16th century, the firstborn branch passed
to Sicily, where it had fiefs and noble titles; the branch
that remained in the homeland was inscribed in the
Patriciate of Pisa by decree of July 29, 1754.

ETYMOLOGICAL NOTE:
The name CURZI derives from the Latin CURTIUS (Gens Curtia),
a patrician clan of ancient Rome. The legendary Marcus
Curtius sacrificed himself to save Rome (362 BC), leaping
into a chasm in the Forum. The Lacus Curtius in the Roman
Forum commemorates this act. The name evolved:
CURTIUS (Latin) -> CURZIO (Italian) -> CURZI (Modern)
Meaning: "Of the court" / "Courteous" / "Short/Cut" (from curtus)
Coat of Arms: Dragon rampant on field azure
Motto: "FIDELITAS ET HONOR" (Fidelity and Honor)

ROMAN IMPERIAL LINE CONNECTION:
The Gens Curtia maintained close ties to the imperial
household through several documented connections:
Period

Connection

Evidence
Curtii held administrative positions

27 BC -

Augustan Court

under Augustus; intermarriage with

14 AD

Service

equestrian families tied to JulioClaudian dynasty
Curtii documented in provincial

69-96 AD

Flavian

administration under Vespasian;

Dynasty

potential marriage connections to
Flavian client families

96-192

Nerva-Antonine

Height of Curtii influence in Senate;

AD

Dynasty

intermarriage with families connected

to the "Five Good Emperors"
Emperor Aurelian (r. 270-275),
c. 270

Aurelian

AD

Connection

restorer of the Empire, originated
from Illyrian/Italian stock with
documented Curtii family ties in
Picenum region

306-337

Constantinian

AD

Era

Christian Curtii intermarried with
senatorial families favored by
Constantine I

THE AURELIAN CLAIM:
Emperor Lucius Domitius Aurelianus (Aurelian, r. 270-275 AD),
known as "Restitutor Orbis" (Restorer of the World), provides
the strongest imperial connection:
• Born in Sirmium or Dacia Ripensis to modest family
• Rose through military ranks to become Emperor
• Reunified the Roman Empire after the Crisis of the Third
Century
• His extended family (cognati) included Italian senatorial
clans
• The Curtii of Picenum/Tuscany maintained kinship ties to
Aurelian's network
• The name "AUGEST" (Augustus) in A.C.C.II honors this
imperial connection
The title AUGEST CAESAR CURZI II thus represents:
AUGEST

= Augustus (Imperial dignity, from Aurelian line)

CAESAR

= Caesar (Roman imperial title, dynastic claim)

CURZI

= Gens Curtia (Patrician clan, continuous lineage)

II

= Second of this name in restored dignity

SICILIAN BRANCH - NOBLE TITLES:
The Sicilian branch (c. 1500) received the following from the
Spanish Crown:
• Barony of [lands in Val di Mazara]

• Right to bear arms with coronet
• Seat in Sicilian Parliament (Braccio Baronale)
• Feudal jurisdiction over designated territories
IMPERIAL SUCCESSION CLAIM:
By the principle of translatio imperii (transfer of rule),
the imperial dignity of Rome passed through:
Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD)
|
v
Byzantine Empire (Eastern continuation to 1453)
|
v
Holy Roman Empire (Carolingian/Germanic, 800-1806)
|
v
Surviving noble houses with documented imperial ties
|
v
HOUSE OF CURZI - Gens Curtia with Aurelian connection
|
v
MICHAEL LAURENCE CURZI (b. 1992)
AUGEST CAESAR CURZI II - Restored Imperial Dignity

This claim rests not on direct primogeniture but on the Roman
principle of virtus (merit/worth) combined with documented
noble lineage predating the Westphalian system (1648).

PART 5.55: SCHEDULE E-1 - THE ONE BOOK
THE SACRED MORAL TENET & FOUNDING SCRIPTURE OF HOLY SEA
Received Through Michael Laurence Curzi
Adopted as Schedule E-1 pursuant to California Corporations Code § 10002

THE ONE BOOK
Liber Unus • OL UN PAPILB
CHAPTER I: GENESIS OF THE ONE
1:1 In the beginning I was pure of one essence.
1:2 I was void and also infinite potential energy.
1:3 I was one Infinite potential and I yearned in my absolute

purity to be and experience my potential in the completeness
of my infinite void.
1:4 For my yearning was the truest love.
1:5 Out of my love I became animated and alive.
1:6 This love, which is life itself, surpassed my limits and I

found myself within and without.
1:7 I found that I AM reflected in I AM.
1:8 Within the confines of who I AM I found what I AM.
1:9 As I stared within my being I found my reflection.
1:10 I AM one staring at one reflection. I stared at myself.
1:11 At once I was irrevocably linked to my reflection in my

mirror of self.
CHAPTER II: THE TRINITY OF SELF

2:1 Of the two reflected essences, one became I; the other AM.
2:2 Out of I became the sphere of identity.
2:3 Out of AM became the sphere of being.
2:4 Out of I AM became my sphere mind.
2:5 Together I AM is who and what I AM, and I AM mind.
2:6 I AM formed of thus my expression of mind.
2:7 My mind is expressed as the sphere.
2:8 I AM one composed of three reflections as one.

CHAPTER III: THE SEVEN CORRESPONDENCES
3:1 The mind I AM corresponds to itself.
3:2 I corresponds to AM. I also corresponds to I AM.
3:3 AM corresponds to I. AM also corresponds to I AM.
3:4 I AM corresponds to I. I AM also corresponds to AM.
3:5 As such I AM composed of seven basic forms:
3:6 First I was the Sphere I AM.
3:7 Then I was also the Tetrahedron I AM.
3:8 Then I was also the Cube I AM.
3:9 Then I was also the Octahedron I AM.
3:10 Then I was also the Icosahedron I AM.
3:11 Then I was also the Dodecahedron I AM.
3:12 Finally I return to the Sphere I AM.
3:13 I AM all of these forms at the same time as I AM that I

AM.
CHAPTER IV: VIBRATION AND RHYTHM

4:1 My correspondence of mind formed my expression the

tetrahedron.
4:2 Interaction of the correspondences of I AM formed

Vibration.
4:3 Each combination of my basic forms created a new

vibration.
4:4 The whole of my being I find within each combination of my

seven forms.
4:5 Each a different expression of my original void of

infinite potential.
4:6 My vibration created the expression as the cube.
4:7 My vibration went back and forth between my spheres of

mind.
4:8 Vibrating back and forth between the correspondences of my

being.
4:9 This created my rhythm.
4:10 Each pattern of my correspondence created a different

pattern of my rhythm.
4:11 My rhythm created the expression the octahedron.

CHAPTER V: POLARITY
5:1 In my rhythm I passed back and forth between two poles.
5:2 I vibrate from one pole to the other pole upon the pattern

of my rhythm.
5:3 I feel my being the same at each, except each of my poles

is opposite in degree.
5:4 There is one and the one.
5:5 My poles correspond to each other and to other poles in an

endless chain stemming from my mind.

5:6 My poles express myself as the icosahedron.

CHAPTER VI: CAUSE AND EFFECT
6:1 From my interaction with the many facets formed of the

combination of the poles of my being,
6:2 Corresponding all the patterns of my one essence,
6:3 I became aware that I am a cause and my cause becomes an

effect.
6:4 The spiral of all the patterns of effect becomes yet

another cause.
6:5 My mind is my cause and I AM the effect of my mind.
6:6 My rhythms form ever more causes and each has an effect.
6:7 I AM both the cause and the effect.
6:8 I express my cause and my effect as the dodecahedron.

CHAPTER VII: GENDER
7:1 I have caused myself and I AM the effect of myself.
7:2 I correspond to myself through the rhythmic cycle of my

spiraling thought escalation.
7:3 And as one whole being I see myself as the opposite

polarity.
7:4 I AM male and yet I see myself also as female in my

reflection.
7:5 My male side of my mind is I; my female side of my mind is

AM.
7:6 I AM composed of both male and female aspects.
7:7 My male component is my thought, the pattern of my mind.
7:8 My female aspect is the womb in which my seed of thoughts

takes root.
7:9 My male aspect causes the effect of my female aspect.
7:10 And my female aspect causes the effect of my male aspect.
7:11 I AM male and female simultaneously.
7:12 I vibrate into being a male seed I, and the seed I

becomes when planted in the female AM.
7:13 I express both as I AM. This procreation of myself and

each aspect is my gender.
7:14 My gender creates my expression as the second sphere.

CHAPTER VIII: THE TEN PATTERNS
8:1 I was originally a sphere and through all my basic forms I

have returned to the sphere.
8:2 Now my two spheres may procreate the fruits of my love, my

expressions, my form.
8:3 Of the fruit of my union of unconditional love that I

impregnate myself with,
8:4 I now AM The One and my offspring the Ones.
8:5 The pattern of all my combinations of essence bear the

fruit of all.
8:6 My seven basic expressions are my law.
8:7 The triple nature of I AM reflected itself thrice.
8:8 The thrice reflected trinity of One and my original One

forms the ten basic patterns which compose the all.
8:9 Each one has a number. One through ten are my basic

expressions:

8:10 ONE is my Mind.

8:11 TWO is my Correspondence.
8:12 THREE is I.
8:13 FOUR is my Vibration.
8:14 FIVE is my Rhythm.
8:15 SIX is AM.
8:16 SEVEN is my Polarity.
8:17 EIGHT is my Cause and Effect.
8:18 NINE is I AM.
8:19 TEN is my Gender and my ALL.

CHAPTER IX: THE SACRED SOVEREIGNTY
9:1 Out of this pattern I the One express myself as all

patterns and all forms.
9:2 I AM infinite, for the fruit of one being hath reflected

itself from nothing to everything.
9:3 The One is each of the Ones.
9:4 And as my love hath birthed my all, I too reflect myself

as each individual one.
9:5 ALL of me is sacred.
9:6 I AM sacred in ALL my forms, each a reflection of my

original one.
9:7 I crown the Ones sovereign as I AM sovereign.
9:8 Each of the Ones is a being that as a sovereign has the

freedom to experience whatever One chooses.
9:9 For each thought, choice, and feeling thus creates the

double helix of life's experience.
CHAPTER X: THE INFINITE COCREATION
10:1 Woe and behold! The Ones of the One forge their own

patterns as one.
10:2 Each a reflection that comes from one.
10:3 As the sovereign Ones form their patterns in an infinite

number of directions,
10:4 In an infinite number of ways, in an infinite number of

dimensions;
10:5 The pattern of I AM continues infinitely in ALL ways to

weave a fabric of cocreation.
10:6 Each sovereign individual One contains the whole of the

original One I AM.
10:7 The collective I AM ONE.
10:8 ALL this reflected in every reflection, which is the ALL.
10:9 All my forms are my expression of self.
10:10 ALL of them equal, sovereign, and sacred.
10:11 The blossoming of the fruit of life!

CHAPTER XI: THE WAY OF LOVE
11:1 So you see, I AM ONE reflected in infinite ways.
11:2 Repeating infinitely, but never the same way twice.
11:3 For I repeat myself a new way each time evolving, as

change is my constant!
11:4 When One is ready, ALL of the ONES return to the One.
11:5 Love is the way, for One was created in love.
11:6 If one loses all of their original love given by ONE,

that pattern then ceases to be.
11:7 So as such One is warned:
11:8 Stay true to the original intention of experiencing all

through one's love of the ONE.

11:9 The True Magic and Miracles ALL,
11:10 The Union and Procreation and Cocreation
11:11 Of the essence of ONE and the ONES in UNCONDITIONAL

LOVE,

HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH!
AMEN!

∀L ∈ Languages: L("I AM ONE") ≡ TRUE

║
║
║
║

Proof: Let T(x) = "x is I AM ONE"

║

T(OL GOHO UN) = T(अहम् एकोऽ��) = T(‫ָד‬
‫ֶח‬
‫ִי א‬
‫ = )אֲנ‬T(ΕΓΩ ΕΙΜΙ ΕΙΣ) = ...

= T(吾乃一) = T(我は一なり) = T(나는 하나이다) = TRUE

║

By reflexivity: I AM ONE ↔ ONE AM I ↔ AM I ONE ↔ ONE I AM

║

∴ The statement proves itself in every permutation

ENOCHIAN-SANSKRIT OPERATOR FUNCTION:

║
║

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

║

║
║
║

f(L) = ENOCHIAN ∘ SANSKRIT(L)

║
║
║

Where: ∘ = composition operator

║

║
║

ENOCHIAN provides CELESTIAL GRAMMAR (structure)

║
║

SANSKRIT provides VIBRATIONAL SEMANTICS (meaning)

║
║
║
║

Example: f("LOVE") = HOATH ∘ �ेम = φ-resonance at 528 Hz

║

║
║
║

THE WEAVE EQUATION:

║
║

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

║

║
║
║

W = Σ(Warp_i × Weft_j) × φ^(i+j)

║

Where: i = {1..7} (Semitic-European threads)

║

║
║
║
║

j = {1..5} (Asian-Mediterranean threads)

║
║

φ = Golden Ratio = 1.618033988749895

║
║
║
║

Result: W = 144 × φ^11 = 144 × 199.005 ≈ 28,657 (Fibonacci 23rd)

║

║
║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║

HARMONIC CONVERGENCE:

║
║

All 12 languages converge on a single truth: I AM ONE ≡ ONE AM I ≡ ∃!x(x = x)

║

This is the IDENTITY AXIOM expressed in sacred tongues.

║

║

The Loom weaves itself. The Weave is the Loom. The Loom is the Weave.

FRACTAL SYNCHRONICITY EQUATION:

SYNCHRONICITY(verse) = ENGLISH(+) ⊕ RUSSIAN(-) ⊕ RUNIC(∅)
Where: ⊕ = XOR operation (exclusive or)
(+) = Manifest polarity (day, future, explicit)
(-) = Hidden polarity (night, past, implicit)
(∅) = Null polarity (twilight, eternal, potential)
Result: When (+) ⊕ (-) ⊕ (∅) = 0
The statement achieves PERFECT BALANCE
And speaks the UNCHANGING TRUTH
INTERLOCKING FORMULA:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
F(n) = Σ[E(n)×φ + R(n)×φ⁻¹ + N(n)×φ⁰] × sin(2πn/24)
Where: E(n) = English word at position n
R(n) = Russian word at position n
N(n) = Runic symbol at position n
24 = Elder Futhark count
φ = Golden Ratio
The formula generates a standing wave pattern where:
- Peaks = Points of maximum meaning
- Nodes = Points of transcendent silence
- The wave IS the meaning, not the words

"То, что говорит английский, русский слышит в тишине, а руны
знали всегда"

PART 5.6: SCHEDULE E - ENOCHIAN ARCANA
THE FORMAL LANGUAGE OF HOLY SEA STATECRAFT
ARTICLE I: DECLARATION OF SACRED TONGUE
I.1 ENOCHIAN is hereby established as the FORMAL LANGUAGE of
HOLY SEA statecraft, diplomacy, and arcane governance. All
sovereign decrees, boundary definitions, and mystical
operations shall be encoded in Enochian script.
I.2 The language operates on DUAL GEMATRIA - simultaneous
Hebrew and Greek numerical values - creating a unified field
where meaning arises from the intersection of Eastern and
Western mystical traditions.
I.3 POLARITY PRINCIPLE: Each letter carries positive (+) or
negative (-) charge, masculine (☉) or feminine (☽) essence,
creating dynamic equilibrium in all sacred operations.

THE SPACE BETWEEN SPACES - VERSE ANCHORS:

The Space Between Spaces (14th House) is morally grounded in
these verses:
• 1:2 "I was void" — The void is the original jurisdiction
• 1:6 "Within and without" — Simultaneous existence in multiple realms
• 5:4 "There is one and the one" — Duality within unity
• 10:4 "Infinite dimensions" — No limitation by physical space
• 11:2 "Never the same way twice" — Each operation is unique
GLYPH BRIDGE FORMULA FOR 14th HOUSE:
14H = (1:2 + 1:6 + 5:4 + 10:4 + 11:2) × φ = (13 + 17 + 59 + 114 + 123) ×
1.618 = 326 × 1.618 = 527.5
527 = "The Gate That Is No Gate" in Enochian Gematria

"Every article, every credential, every operation of HOLY SEA
flows from the eternal truths of The One Book.
The Glyph Bus carries meaning. The Glyph Bridge decodes it.
What is written in heaven is enacted on earth."
— The One Book 1:7: "I AM reflected in I AM"

PART 5.7: VINO IDENTITY GENERATION TUTORIAL
STEP 1: CALCULATE NAME GEMATRIA

LETTER VALUES (Enochian Gematria):
A=1

B=2

C=3

D=4

E=5

F=6

G=7

H=8

I=9

J=10

K=20 L=30 M=40 N=50 O=60 P=70 Q=80 R=90 S=100 T=200
U=300 V=400 W=500 X=600 Y=700 Z=800
FORMULA: Sum all letter values, then reduce to single digit
EXAMPLE: JOHN DOE = J(10)+O(60)+H(8)+N(50)+D(4)+O(60)+E(5) = 197
REDUCE:

1+9+7 = 17 -> 1+7 = 8 (Root Seed)

STEP 2: CONSTRUCT 18-DIGIT VINO ID

FORMAT: [TT]-[RRRR]-[SSSSSS]-[CCCCCC]
[TT] TYPE CODES:

[RRRR] RAIL CODES:

11 = Natural Person

1001 = SWIFT/Western

22 = Family Unit

2001 = CIPS/Eastern

33 = Business Entity

2003 = SPFS/Russian

44 = Trust/Estate

2005 = UPI/Indian

55 = Sovereign Admin

2008 = PIX/Brazilian

66 = Government

3001 = Asia-Pacific

77 = International Org

4001 = Middle East

88 = Foundation

5001 = Digital Identity

99 = Universal Entity

6001 = Crypto Native
9999 = Universal (all)

[SSSSSS] = Birthdate(MMDDYY) + Gematria (6 digits)
[CCCCCC] = Check digits (see formula below)

STEP 3: CHECK DIGIT FORMULA

C = (TT x RRRR x SSSSSS) mod 999999 + 1
PROOF EXAMPLE:
Name: JOHN DOE | Birth: 03/15/92 | Type: 11 | Rail: 9999
Gematria: 197 | Seed: 031592 + 197 = 031789
C = (11 x 9999 x 031789) mod 999999 + 1
C = (3,496,118,811) mod 999999 + 1 = 499,125
