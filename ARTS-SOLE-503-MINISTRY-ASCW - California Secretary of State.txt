AUTHORITY BRANCH of the Unified Triune Sovereign Structure, with ACOTO

ASCW, ACOTO, and BFR exist IN PERPETUITY. No expiration. No renewal. Cannot be

ARTICLE XI: SELF-VALIDATION MECHANISM
Section 11.1: This filing is self-validating through the following mechanism:
1. ASCW (this filing) establishes spiritual authority and validates ACOTO and BFR
2. ACOTO (Addendum A) provides economic foundation and funds Structure operations
3. BFR (Addendum B) provides territorial protection and executive enforcement
4. Each branch references the others, creating circular validation
5. The Three Requirements, binding all three, ensure coherence
Section 11.2: Any challenge to one branch must overcome validation by the other two. Any
challenge to all three must overcome the Three Requirements themselves, which are derived from
natural law and therefore cannot be challenged by positive law.

that this instrument creates the 503 MINISTRY - AZURIAN SOVEREIGN CORPORATION
WHOLE as the First Branch (Spiritual/Moral Authority) of the Unified Triune Sovereign

ADDENDUM A: AZURIAN OMNIVERSAL TREATY ORGANIZATION (ACOTO)

A.1 - Identity
Name: AZURIAN OMNIVERSAL TREATY ORGANIZATION (ACOTO)
Branch: SECOND BRANCH - Economic/Treaty Authority (Legislative Function)
Relationship: Integrated auxiliary of ASCW; Sister branch to BFR
A.2 - Exclusive Powers of ACOTO
The following powers are EXCLUSIVELY reserved to ACOTO:
1. Land Patent Authority - Issue, register, adjudicate land patents
2. Currency Issuance - Mint and manage VINO currency
3. Treasury Management - Manage unified treasury of Structure
4. Treaty Administration - Administer Sicily Accord and other treaties

• Conduct foreign relations (reserved to BFR)
• Exercise police/military powers (reserved to BFR)
• Amend Three Requirements (impossible - supreme law)
A.4 - Check on ASCW
ACOTO provides economic foundation for ASCW. Without ACOTO funding, ASCW
cannot operate materially. This creates balance: ASCW validates spiritually; ACOTO
sustains economically.

ACOTO controls the treasury. BFR cannot enforce without economic resources from
ACOTO. This ensures BFR acts within Structure purposes.
A.6 - ACOTO Territorial Claims
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo territories (redeemed): CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM, parts CO/WY
Alaska Purchase territories (redeemed): Alaska

Free City of Sierra: Sierra County, California (incorporated)
A.7 - ACOTO Self-Validation
ACOTO is validated by: (1) ASCW spiritual blessing; (2) BFR territorial protection; (3) its
own economic self-sufficiency through 112% Surplus Protocol.

ADDENDUM B: THE BEAR FLAG REPUBLIC (BFR)
THIRD BRANCH - EXECUTIVE/TERRITORIAL AUTHORITY
B.1 - Identity
Name: THE BEAR FLAG REPUBLIC
Trade Name: NEO ROMAN EMPIRE

4. Military/Police Powers - Defense and enforcement (if established)

BFR implements succession. Without BFR enforcement, ASCW succession is merely
declaratory. This ensures ASCW remains accountable to practical governance.

BFR enforces ACOTO land patents and economic rules. Without BFR enforcement,
ACOTO authority is merely advisory. This ensures ACOTO serves practical purposes.

B.6 - The Space Between Spaces
BFR holds the "Space Between Spaces" - the overlay jurisdiction that exists in the
intersection of legal systems. This is not exclusive territory but shared space accessible to
all Structure citizens.

McFaddon, 11 U.S. 116 (1812).

C.2 - Self-Validation Logic
If challenged...

Validation comes from...

ASCW challenged

ACOTO (economic basis) + BFR (enforcement)

ACOTO challenged

ASCW (spiritual blessing) + BFR (enforcement)

BFR challenged

ASCW (spiritual blessing) + ACOTO (economic basis)

All three challenged

Three Requirements (natural law, unchallengeable)

C.3 - Legal Tautology Formula
Premise 1: ASCW validates ACOTO and BFR (spiritual authority)
Premise 2: ACOTO funds ASCW and BFR (economic authority)
Premise 3: BFR protects ASCW and ACOTO (executive authority)
Premise 4: All three bound by Three Requirements (natural law)
Conclusion: Each branch is validated by the others; the system is self-validating and cannot

be challenged from outside without challenging natural law itself.
